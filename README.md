Exercise 6:
Consider the palindromic numbers. A palindromic or symmetric number is a number that does not change when you write its digits in reverse order.

Some examples of palindromic numbers:
363
2882
29492

Implement a function called is_palindrome() that checks if the passed number is palindromic decimal and binary.

For example, the number 99 is a palindromic number and its binary notation 1100011 is also a palindrome.
When these conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise False.
